## Description
Marvel Weather is an app that uses two APIs. The goal of this project is to allow users to click on the weather icon to generate a random weather condition around the world. Based on the weather conditons generated, a Marvel Hero that relates to that conditions will pop up. On the hero page, the users can explore an overview of the hero, action shots, an image and quotes gallery, and meet the real life hero. 

Although some heros may not pop up depending on the weather conditions and the current season. For example, the hero Iceman will only pop up if the condition is snowing. In othercase, a Navbar is incorporated on the righthand side with the list of heros for the user to view for their curiosity and enjoyment. 

Below are the Marvel Heros used in the App and their Weather Conditions........


| Heros  | Chance of Popping Up based on their Weather Condtion |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Human Torch | Weather Condtion: Clear Sky or Sunny  |
| Iceman   | Weather Condtion: Snowing |
| Storm  | Weather Condtion: Rain or Cloudy  |
| Thor  | Weather Condtion: Thunderstorm  |



## How Does it Work?
  * **Step 1:** User click on the weather icon in the middle of screen that will then proceed to generate a random weather condition                  and a Marvel Hero that relates to the current weather.

## How did we make it?

| Languages | 
| ------------- |
| HTML  | 
| CSS| 
| Javascript  | 

| API Used | 
| ------------- |
| Marvel API: https://developer.marvel.com/  | 
| Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api | 


## Obstacles and Challenges 
   * Getting the two APIs to work, because it required a complicated procedure to access it remotely. 
   * Trying to implement a Responsive Design that works on Chrome on OSX, iOS devices, and Android devices with at least three breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop.
   * Github - Most of which were our first time. Some problems face were trying to merge files and solving merge conflicts.
